# Connector App Hub (Demo App for Connector API)

This project allows managing apps for the Connector API and provides a built-in example connector for demonstration purposes. 

Look at [Connector API getting started](https://developers.liveperson.com/connector-api-getting-started.html) for a better
understanding.

---
`Important!`

It is recommended to use this app only with test accounts. When using the demo connector, the app Id and conversation Id will be stored in you browser local storage. This information is not deleted on log out. However this data cannot be use for creating requests or log in to your account.

## Requirements.

- Node 6.9.0 or higher, together with NPM 3 or higher.
- [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/) 1.7.3 or higher. 
- A valid brandID with _Async prop Messaging_ enabled.
- An installed APP for your brandID with the data sources configured in LiveEngage. 
- Your server must be accessible if you want to receive events from Webhooks. Or you can use a tool to redirect all the
 notifications from outside to your internal network.
  * (optional). Use [NgRok](#running-ngrok) for redirecting the Webhooks notifications from internet to your local host.
  Run it with the port 8282 by default ```./ngRok http 8282``` .

## Installation

In order to install the project dependencies type this command in a terminal from the root folder where the project is located:

 ```npm install``` 

## How to make it running locally

1. ```npm run start-local``` will build the project and start the server.
2. Open ``` http://localhost:8282``` in your browser. 
3. Log in with a valid LE account.

### Running NgRok

  You can use [NgRok](https://ngrok.com/) as an optional tool for redirecting the Webhooks notifications from the internet to your local host.
  The default port that we use in our server is 8282. To run it, you have to [download](https://ngrok.com/download) and execute the following command (in the same directory):
  
  ```./ngRok http 8282``` 
  
![alt text](docs/gifs/ngrock1.gif)


### Running with Docker

Requirements: [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) installed and running in your computer. 

NOTE! The Dockerfile for local builds is located in 'docker_local' directory.
1. Create the image ```docker build -f docker_local/Dockerfile -t demo-connector-app-local .```
2. Run the image ```docker run -p 8282:8282 -d demo-connector-app-local ```  
(After this command, You need to wait 1 or 2 minutes till be able to open the app in a browser)
3. Open ``` http://localhost:8282``` in your browser. 

## Usage

You must Login with a valid brand Id, user and password. If the login process was successful, the application will redirect you to the home page. This page contains a list of installed apps compatible with the Connector API.

![alt text](docs/imgs/home.png)

### Create a new app

1. Click on "Create App" button. It will pop up a new dialog window.
2. You must fill up the required fields. Application name and description are the minimum required data (other required data is automatically added when you click on install). Note: If you select the "demo app" check box, it will provide you with this "app server endpoint" ready to test Webhooks notifications (demo). If desired, you can edit and change this application configuration later.
3. If all required fields are completed and the form is valid you will be able to click on install.

#### Advanced Webhooks configuration

 When you introduce an endpoint in the application Installation details form, it wil be automatically assigned to every kind of event.
  
  You can customize endpoints per event type in the "Advaced Webhooks configuration" form and add custom headers. (e.g. you can use different server to handle Content type Events)
 
 ![alt text](docs/imgs/webhooksConf.png)

#### Engagement configuration

 You can change the engagement properties of your app here. This affects the Engagement design possibilities when designing a campaign for messaging. The Default values are automatically assigned to your app if nothing is changed.

### Enable, Disable and Uninstall

Open the action menu of an app from a list and click on the desired action.

 ![alt text](/docs/imgs/actions_menu.png)
 
### Edit an existing app

  You can edit an existing app configuration: Open the actions menu of an app from the list and click on edit. After the changes are done, just click on the update button.

### Demo app

Upon installing your app, you can choose the Demo option. This will change every endpoint to ``https://{demo app server url}/notifications/event``, where ``{demo app server url}`` is replaced by the current host. After installing the app, you can choose the demo option from the action menu. 

Note: The demo action also works, when you don't change the endpoint urls. However, you won't receive any events from LiveEngange.

#### Create conversation

1. Type any message in order to start a conversation and press enter.
2. You can login with you account in LiveEngage platform (better to use another user for that brand in order to avoid conflicts), see the sent messages, Webhooks notifications etc. 

Note: Before starting a conversation, you can select some headers that will be sent in every request. This can be used, for example, to activate the Auto Messages feature. Also you can modify the Campaign Id or Skill.

![alt text](docs/gifs/example.gif)

#### File sharing

First you need to enable the file sharing feature for your account, [click here for more information](https://developers.liveperson.com/messaging-window-api-tutorials-file-sharing.html#step-1---enable-file-sharing).

You can click on the open file button next to the chat box text input and select a valid file from your disk.

#### Auto Messages

Auto Messages must be properly configured for your account. Then You can select the AUTO_MESSAGES feature header and start a conversation. If everything was property configured you should receive your automatic messages.

#### Post Conversation Survey

Before being able to use this feature you need Post Conversation Surveys configured for your account.
[click here for more information](https://developers.liveperson.com/messaging-window-api-tutorials-post-conversation-survey-pcs.html).

Before starting a new conversation you must enter the Survey Skill Id and select the features RICH_CONTENT, QUICK_REPLIES and MULTI_DIALOG. Once the conversation started you must close the dialog by clicking on "Close conversation with PCS". If everything was property configured, you will receive the survey events.

![alt text](docs/imgs/pcs.png)

## Settings

Before running the app, maybe you want to change some configuration parameters in [settings.json](settings.json):

  1. [CSDS_DOMAIN] : The URL of the Domain API from which you can get the base URLs of any service (the production Domain API is set by default).
  2. [CSDS_DOMAIN_QA] : The URL of the Domain API  in QA.
  3. [SERVER_HTTP_PORT] : The port of the server listening for Webhooks notifications (this app server).
  
  
### Configure the Webhooks endpoints

In your app installation you need to add this webhook listener server url:

``https://{demo app server}/notifications/event``

NOTE: You would need to configure an HTTPS proxy server with valid certificates that redirect all request to http://localhost:8282/notifications/event
Webhooks require HTTPS.

## Development Mode:

Angular CLI provides a fast development server using Webpack. Every change is automatically refreshed in the browser.

To run the application using the dev server open a terminal and type the following:

1. ```node app``` to run the server
2. Open another terminal and type```npm run build-watch``` to build and watch for changes in the UI
3. Open ``` http://localhost:8282``` in your browser. All changes in the web folder would be reflected immediately after clicking on refresh.

### Project structure

- Server: NodeJS server used as notification server (receive Webhooks notifications and map it to the correct conversation).
The server is also used as a bridge to avoid Cross-Domain restrictions in the browser.
- Web app: Angular 8 project.

### Sending and handling conversation events

The demo connector app can handle most of the conversation events described in the 
[developers documentation](https://developers.liveperson.com/connector-api-examples-send-chat-state-events.html)
and especially in [send-endpoint section](https://developers.liveperson.com/connector-api-api-reference-send.html#mspublishevent-properties-2).

Most of those events are reflected in the UI, e.g. when a user is typing or a message is read.

####  Message sequence number

The sequence of every message is obtained after each request. A Message object is created with this sequence number. This
is very important to save in order to handle the message status events like READ, ACCEPT, etc.

```json
{
    "reqId": "1",
    "code": "OK",
    "body": {
        "sequence": 0
    }
}
```

#### Chat state events


 - COMPOSING: A request is sent with this event when consumer starts to typing in the chat box.
   Example of consumer request:
     ```json
    {  
       "kind":"req",
       "id":"1",
       "type":"ms.PublishEvent",
       "body":{  
          "dialogId":"b3aea67d-01ca-4bf7-af4f-9897cf6b77a7",
          "event":{  
             "type":"ChatStateEvent",
             "chatState":"COMPOSING"
          }
       }
    }
    
    ```
 
   Example of a received notification, in this case when agent is composing:
     ```json
       {
      "kind": "notification",
      "body": {
        "changes": [
          {
            "originatorId": "662eb2c6-cf25-5ea8-8fbd-9f1781558c24",
            "originatorMetadata": {
                   "id": "662eb2c6-cf25-5ea8-8fbd-9f1781558c24",
                   "role": "ASSIGNED_AGENT"
                 },
                 "event": {
                   "type": "ChatStateEvent",
                   "chatState": "COMPOSING"
                 },
                 "conversationId": "b3aea67d-01ca-4bf7-af4f-9897cf6b77a7",
                 "dialogId": "b3aea67d-01ca-4bf7-af4f-9897cf6b77a7"
               }
             ]
           },
           "type": "ms.MessagingEventNotification"
         }
    ```

     In order to show that the consumer has stopped typing, we need to pass any other state which is different 
     from COMPOSING (it does not matter which value you choose, as long as it is not COMPOSING) i.e. ACTIVE , INACTIVE, GONE, PAUSE.
     In this app, we pass a PAUSE event every time the consumer stops typing.
      
      ![alt text](docs/imgs/typing.png) 

 
 - PAUSE: In this APP this event is sent after consumer stops typing.

 - ACTIVE: LiveEngage normally sends ACTIVE events after composing instead of PAUSE. In this app ACTIVE is sent
 when the window focus event is triggered. That happens when you are in the demo app tab or by clicking into the chat box after
 return from another window.
 
    Example received notification:
     ```json
    {
      "kind": "notification",
      "body": {
        "changes": [
          {
            "originatorId": "31fe13ba27250bfff439a6f875cfd135cf64f680f9dded3b123cb0529d1e5a29",
            "originatorMetadata": {
              "id": "31fe13ba27250bfff439a6f875cfd135cf64f680f9dded3b123cb0529d1e5a29",
              "role": "CONSUMER"
            },
            "event": {
              "type": "ChatStateEvent",
              "chatState": "ACTIVE"
            },
            "conversationId": "b3aea67d-01ca-4bf7-af4f-9897cf6b77a7",
            "dialogId": "b3aea67d-01ca-4bf7-af4f-9897cf6b77a7"
          }
        ]
      },
      "type": "ms.MessagingEventNotification"
    }
    ```
 - GONE: In this app, this event is sent when a window Blur event is triggered, that means when a user opens other tab or window.
 - INACTIVE: Not implemented for this app. It could be added easily and send a request after the user does not use the app for a 
determined period of time. 
 

#### Message status events 

The demo connector app also can handle most of the message status events, i.e. when a message is send, read or accepted.

- ACCEPT: This event request indicates to the agent the list of messages that were accepted.

  ```json
  {
    "kind": "req",
    "id": "1,",
    "type": "ms.PublishEvent",
    "body": {
      "dialogId": "88166f48-6254-496f-9508-96b044fc0442",
      "event": {
        "type": "AcceptStatusEvent",
        "status": "ACCEPT",
        "sequenceList": [
          2,3,5 
        ]
      }
    }
  }
    
  ```
  
- READ: This event request indicates to the agent the list of messages which were read.

  ```json
  {
    "kind": "req",
    "id": "1,",
    "type": "ms.PublishEvent",
    "body": {
      "dialogId": "88166f48-6254-496f-9508-96b044fc0442",
      "event": {
        "type": "AcceptStatusEvent",
        "status": "READ",
        "sequenceList": [
          2,3,5
        ]
      }
    }
  }
    
  ```
  
  When an agent has read some of your messages, you will get via Webhooks a notification like this:
  
  ```json
        {
    "kind": "notification",
    "body": {
      "changes": [
        {
          "sequence": 9,
          "originatorId": "662eb2c6-cf25-5ea8-8fbd-9f1781558c24",
          "originatorMetadata": {
            "id": "662eb2c6-cf25-5ea8-8fbd-9f1781558c24",
            "role": "ASSIGNED_AGENT"
          },
          "serverTimestamp": 1537343869240,
          "event": {
            "type": "AcceptStatusEvent",
            "status": "READ",
            "sequenceList": [
              6
            ]
          },
          "conversationId": "f66ad121-8dcb-4430-9fc2-731e961f6eae",
          "dialogId": "f66ad121-8dcb-4430-9fc2-731e961f6eae"
        }
      ]
    },
    "type": "ms.MessagingEventNotification"
  }
     
  ```
- NACK: Not implemented for this app.
- ACTION: Not implemented for this app.

## Deployment 

For a correct deployment of this app, we need to consider the following:

 -  A HTTPS server in order to be able to receive events via Webhooks.
 -  Valid certificates are needed in order to use the Webhooks service.
 -  A reverse proxy like Ngnix would redirect all HTTPS requests to our HTTP server. If we don't do this, the browser will block all HTTP requests considered not secure.
 -  Related to the previous point, we need to keep the properties protocol and port in `web/environment/environment.prod.ts` like defult: 
    
      ```
        ...
        protocol: "https",
        port: "",
        ...
      ```
 -  Run it with ```mpm start```. This will build the project with the production configuration.
 
### Session Secret

In order to create a secure session, we must create the secret environment variable: `process.env.secret`, if no environment variable is provided the default session key  
will be used which is not secure. If you are using the docker-compose file included in this project, you need to provide a `.env` file in the deployment folded that contains `SESSION_SECRET="{your_secret}"`. If the session secret is not provided, it won't be possible to deploy the application.

  
### Configuring Nginx

 - Redirect all HTTP requests to HTTPS:

```
  http {
  ...
  server {
        listen       80;
        return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
     }
   
```
 - Redirect HTTPS requests to internal HTTP server and port: 
 ```
  server {
        listen       443 ssl http2 default_server;
        ...
        
        location / {		
                proxy_pass http://localhost:8282;
              }
        ...
 ```

 - Add valid certs in HTTPS server configuration: 

```
 server {
       listen       443 ssl http2 default_server;
       
       ...
       
       ssl on;   
       ssl_certificate "/your/path/to/file.pem";
       ssl_certificate_key "/your/path/to/file.key";
       ssl_session_cache shared:SSL:1m;
       ssl_session_timeout  10m;
       ssl_ciphers HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5;
       ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;
       
       ...
```
 - Configuration for SSE (Server Send Events). We are sending the received events to the UI through SSE and we need 
it to work properly with Nginx:

```
       #This deals with the Aggregating issue
       chunked_transfer_encoding off;
       proxy_buffering off;
       proxy_cache off;

       #This deals with the connection closing issue
       proxy_set_header Connection keep-alive;
       proxy_connect_timeout 3600;
       proxy_send_timeout 3600;
       proxy_read_timeout 3600;
       keepalive_timeout 3600;
```
