## Project structure

- Server: NodeJS server used as notification server (receive webhooks notifications and map it to the correct conversation).
The serves is also used as a brige to avoid CORS problems in the browser.
- Web app: Angular 5 project.(Its possible to open a new chat conversation for a random consumer using ur brand credentials).

## Settings
Before running or deployment it is neccesary to care about some configuration parameters:
- settings.json:
  1. [CSDS_DOMAIN] : The domain of the service to get the rest of domains. (QA csds domain by default)
  1. [WEBHOOK_PORT] : The port of the server listening for webhooks notifications. NOTE: The server is running in http and
  https, if u are using https the port cant be chaged (443).
- web/enviroments/enviromment.prod.ts and web/enviroments/enviromment.ts: 
Here we have the the [server] property.
 1. Development Mode (enviromment.ts): server: localhost:8282
 1. Production Mode (enviromment.prod.ts): server: The ip or ur sever domain (where this app is running) and port 8282. (e.g: 192.168.98.82:8282)
 
## Webhooks Setup 
In your app installation you need to add this webhook listener server url:<br/> 

``https://{your server domain or ip}/notifications/event``

### Development Mode:

Angular CLI provides a fast development server using Webpack. Every change is automatically refreshed in the browser.

To run the application using the dev server instead a built project:

1. ```npm install```
2. ```sudo node app``` to run the server
2. ```ng serve``` to run web develpment server
4. open ``` http://localhost:4200``` in your browser. All changes in the web folder would be reflected immediately

### Production Mode:

1. ```npm install```
2. ```ng build --prod```  to build a compiled version.
3. ``sudo node app`` to run the server.
4. Open ``` http://localhost:8282``` in your browser.
